    <h2><mark>Minecraft</mark></h2>
    <p>
      Minecraft is a 2011 sandbox game developed and published by Mojang
      Studios. Originally created by Markus "Notch" Persson using the Java
      programming language, the first public test build was released on 17 May
      2009. The game would continue to be developed over the span of two years,
      until its full release on 18 November 2011. Afterwards, Persson left
      Mojang and gave Jens "Jeb" Bergensten control over the game's development.
      In the years since its release, it has been ported to several platforms,
      including smartphones, tablets, and various video game consoles, primarily
      by 4J Studios. In 2014, Mojang and the Minecraft intellectual property
      were purchased by Microsoft for US$2.5 billion. Minecraft has become the
      best-selling video game of all-time, with over 300 million copies sold and
      nearly 140 million monthly active players as of 2023. In Minecraft,
      players explore a procedurally generated, three-dimensional world with
      virtually infinite terrain made up of voxels. Players can discover and
      extract raw materials, craft tools and items, and build structures,
      earthworks, and machines. Depending on their chosen game mode, players can
      fight hostile mobs, as well as cooperate with or compete against other
      players. The game has two main modes; one being survival mode, where
      players must acquire resources to survive, and a creative mode where
      players have unlimited resources and the ability to fly. Several other
      game modes exist besides the two main ones, such as one that allows
      players to spectate others and one that plays identically to survival
      mode, but features permadeath. The game's large community also offers a
      wide variety of user-generated content, such as modifications, servers,
      skins, texture packs, and custom maps, which add new game mechanics and
      possibilities.

    <h2><mark>Fortnite</mark></h2>
    <p>
      Fortnite is an online video game and game platform developed by Epic Games
      and released in 2017. It is available in six distinct game mode versions
      that otherwise share the same general gameplay and game engine: Fortnite
      Battle Royale, a free-to-play battle royale game in which up to 100
      players fight to be the last person standing; Fortnite: Save the World, a
      cooperative hybrid tower defense-shooter and survival game in which up to
      four players fight off zombie-like creatures and defend objects with traps
      and fortifications they can build; and Fortnite Creative, in which players
      are given complete freedom to create worlds and battle arenas, Lego
      Fortnite, an open world survival game, Rocket Racing, a racing game, and
      Fortnite Festival, a rhythm game. Save the World and Battle Royale were
      released in 2017 as early access titles, while Creative was released on
      December 6, 2018. While the Save the World and Creative versions have been
      successful for Epic Games, Fortnite Battle Royale in particular became an
      overwhelming success and a cultural phenomenon, drawing more than 125
      million players in less than a year, earning hundreds of millions of
      dollars per month. Fortnite as a whole generated $9 billion in gross
      revenue up until December 2019, and it has been listed among the greatest
      games of all time.
